<H3>CROP.100</H3>
<P>The CROP.100 file used by Century version 4.5 has 15 additional parameters: 
</P>
<P></P><PRE>     FRTCINDX    - plant growth type
                     0 - use Great Plains equation to compute root to shoot
                         ratio (fixed carbon allocation based on rainfall)
                     1 - perennial plant (i.e., grass, dynamic carbon
                         allocation)
                     2 - annual plant (i.e., crop, dynamic carbon allocation)
     FRTC(4)     - maximum increase in the fraction of C going to the roots
                   due to water stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2
     FRTC(5)     - maximum increase in the fraction of C going to the roots
                   due to nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2
     CFRTCN(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to roots under maximum
                   water stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1
     CFRTCN(2)   - minimum fraction of C allocated to roots with no water
                   stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1
     CFRTCW(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to roots under maximum
                   nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1
     CFRTCW(2)   - minimum fraction of C allocated to roots with no nutrient
                   stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1
     KMRSP(1)    - the fraction of net primary production that goes to the
                   maintenance respiration storage pool for crops
     CKMRSPMX(1) - maximum fraction of aboveground live C that goes to
                   maintenance respiration for crops
     CKMRSPMX(2) - maximum fraction of belowground live C that goes to
                   maintenance respiration for crops
     NO3PREF(1)  - fraction of N update that is NO3 for crops, currently not
                   being used
     CLAYPG      - number of soil layers used to determine water and mineral
                   N, P, and S that are available for grass/crop growth
     TMPGERM     - germination temperature for the growing degree day
                   submodel, will cause a FRST event when FRTCINDX = 3 or a
                   PLTM event when FRTCINDX = 4 (degrees C)
     DDHARV      - required number of thermal units that need to accumulate to
                   trigger a SENM/HARV event when simulating a grass/crop
                   using the growing degree submodel, FRTCINDX = 3 or 4
     TMPKILL     - temperature at which growth will stop when using the
                   growing degree day submodel, will cause a SENM and LAST
                   event when FRTCINDX = 3 or a HARV and LAST event if
                   FRTCINDX = 4, if the required number of thermal units has
                   not been accumulated prior to trigger a SENM or a HARV
                   event (degrees C)
</PRE>
<P>For reference, here are the definitions for the other FRTC(*) parameters 
which are also used in the new dynamic carbon allocation routines: </P><PRE>     FRTC(1) - fraction of C allocated to roots at planting, with no water or
               nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2
     FRTC(2) - fraction of C allocated to roots at time FRTC(3), with no
               water or nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2
     FRTC(3) - time after planting (months with soil temperature greater than
               RTDTMP) at which the FRTC(2) value is reached, used when
               FRTCINDX = 2
</PRE>
<P>The FRTCINDX, FRTC(*), CFRTCN(*), and CFRTCW(*) parameters are used in the 
new dynamic carbon allocation routines. FRTCINDX is inserted into the crop 
parameterization preceding the FRTC(1) parameter. The FRTC(4), FRTC(5), 
CFRTCN(1), CFRTCN(2), CFRTCW(1), and CFRTCW(2) parameters follow the FRTC(3) 
parameter. </P>
<P>When converting from an existing Century 4.0 CROP.100 file format to a 
Century 4.5 CROP.100 file format the following rules will be used to set default 
values for these parameters. </P>
<OL>
  <LI>If FRTC(1) = 0.0 in the Century 4.0 crop parameterization assume this is a 
  parameterization that should be set to use the Great Plains equation. Set 
  FRTCINDX to 0. 
  <LI>If FRTC(1) != to 0.0 in the Century 4.0 crop parameterization then we 
  cannot make an assumption about what this parameterization represents. The 
  user will be prompted to enter a 1 for a perennial plant, or a 2 for an annual 
  plant to set the FRTCINDX value. </LI></OL>
<P>In all cases FRTC(1), FRTC(2) and FRTC(3) will retain their original Century 
4.0 values. FRTC(4) will be set to 0.2, FRTC(5) will be set to 0.1, CFRTCN(1) 
will be set to 0.4, CFRTCN(2) will be set to 0.25, CFRTCW(1) will be set to the 
original Century 4.0 FRTC(1) value, and CFRTCW(2) will be set to the original 
Century 4.0 FRTC(2) value.</P>
<P>The KMRSP(1), CKMRSPMX(1), and CKMRSPMX(2) parameters are used in the new 
maintenance respiration routines. These parameters are give the following 
default values:</P><PRE>     KMRSP(1)    - 0.20000
     CKMRSPMX(1) - 0.00300
     CKMRSPMX(2) - 0.00300
</PRE>
<P>The NO3PREF(1) parameter is not being used by the model currently but is 
included in this conversion utility for compatability with anticipated future 
code changes. The NO3PREF(1) parameter is given a default value of 0.25000. </P>
<P>The KMRSP(1), CKMRSPMX(1), and CKMRSPMX(2), and NO3PREF(1) parameters follow 
the CO2IRS(1) parameter. </P>
<P>The CLAYPG parameter is added to each crop option in the crop.100 file 
following the NO3PREF(1) parameter. It is given a default value of 4. </P>
<P>The TMPGERM, DDHARV, and TMPKILL parameters are added to the end of each crop 
option in the crop.100 file following the CLAYPG parameter. These parameters are 
given default values of 10.0000, 1500.00, and 7.00000 respectively. These 
parameters are used by DayCent only but are included in the Century crop.100 
file to enable file sharing between the two models. </P>
<P>The definition for the PRDX(1) parameter has been changed and each crop 
option in the crop.100 file should have the value for PRDX(1) set to a default 
value of 0.5. New Century 4.5 PRDX(1) definition: </P><PRE>     PRDX(1) - coefficient for calculating potential aboveground monthly
               production as a function of solar radiation outside the
               atmosphere
</PRE>
<H3>FIRE.100</H3>
<P>The FIRE.100 file used by Century version 4.5 has 11 additional parameters 
and 3 parameters that have had their "names" changed: </P><PRE>     FDFREM(3) - fraction of dead fine branches removed by a fire event
     FDFREM(4) - fraction of dead large wood removed by a fire event
     FRET(1,1) - fraction of C in the burned aboveground material (live
                 shoots, standing dead, and litter) returned to the system
                 following a fire event as charcoal in the passive SOM pool
     FRET(1,2) - fraction of N in the burned aboveground material (live
                 shoots, standing dead, and litter) returned to the system

     FRET(1,3) - fraction of P in the burned aboveground material live
                 shoots, standing dead, and litter) returned to the system
                 following a fire event (NOTE: replaces fret(2))
     FRET(1,4) - fraction of S in the burned aboveground material (live

     FRET(2,1) - fraction of C in the burned dead fine branch material
                 returned to the system following a fire event as charcoal in
                 the passive SOM pool
     FRET(2,2) - fraction of N in the burned dead fine branch material
                 returned to the system following a fire event

                 returned to the system following a fire event
     FRET(2,4) - fraction of S in the burned dead fine branch material
                 returned to the system following a fire event
     FRET(3,1) - fraction of C in the burned dead large wood material returned
                 to the system following a fire event as charcoal in the
                 passive SOM pool

                 to the system following a fire event
     FRET(3,4) - fraction of S in the burned dead large wood material returned
                 to the system following a fire event
</PRE>
<P>The FDFREM(3), FDFREM(4), and FRET(1,1) parameters follow the FDFREM(2) 
parameter. The FRET(1,2) parameter replaces the FRET(1) parameter. The FRET(1,3) 
parameter replaces the FRET(2) parameter. The FRET(1,4) parameter replaces the 
FRET(3) parameter. The remainder of the new FRET(*,*) parameters follow the 
FRET(1,4) parameter. The FRTSH and FNUE(*) parameters follow the FRET(3,4) 
parameter. </P>
<P>The following default values are used for these parameters: </P><PRE>     FDFREM(3) - 0.30000
     FDFREM(4) - 0.20000
     FRET(1,1) - 0.10000
     FRET(1,2) - retains value of FRET(1) from original file

     FRET(3,3) - 0.00000
     FRET(3,4) - 0.00000
</PRE>
<H3>FIX.100</H3>
<P>The FIX.100 file used by Century 4.5 has 2 additional parameters not used in 
Century4 or 5: </P><PRE>     TEFF(4) - slope of line at inflection point
     PSECOC2 - controls the back flow from occluded to secondary P
</PRE>
<P>DayCent5 uses TEFF(1-4) in the same way as Century/DayCent 4.5. </P>
<P>The PSECOC parameter has been renamed PSECOC1 and retains its original 
definition: </P><PRE>     PSECOC1 - controls the flow from secondary to occluded P
</PRE>
<P>The PSECOC2 parameter follows the PSECOC1 parameter. </P>
<P>When running the conversion utility the PSECOC1 parameter retains the value 
for PSECOC and the following default value is used for PSECOC2: </P><PRE>     PSECOC2 - 0.00000
</PRE>
<P>Century 4.5 uses 4 coefficients in the equation for computing the temperature 
effect on decomposition. The TEFF(4) parameter is added to give us the 
additional coefficient required to paramerterize the temperature equation. The 
definitions for the TEFF(*) parameters are as follows: </P><PRE>     TEFF(1) - "x" location of inflection point
     TEFF(2) - "y" location of inflection point
     TEFF(3) - step size (distance from the maximum point to the minimum
               point)
     TEFF(4) - slope of line at inflection point
</PRE>
<P>The TEFF(4) parameter is inserted in the FIX.100 file following the TEFF(3) 
parameter. </P>
<P>When running the conversion utility the following default values are used for 
the TEFF(*) parameters: </P><PRE>     TEFF(1) - 15.4000
     TEFF(2) - 11.7500
     TEFF(3) - 29.7000
     TEFF(4) - 0.03100
</PRE>
<P>The PET calculation is now taking into account solar radition outside of the 
atmosphere and an approximated cloud cover based on temperature range. As a 
result of this change the FWLOSS[4] parameter in the FIX.100 file needs to be 
rescaled. A default value of 0.95 is now recommended for this parameter. </P>
<P>Due to the changes in the snow melting equation the following default values 
will be entered for the TMELT(*) parameters: </P><PRE>     TMELT(1) - 0.00000
     TMELT(2) - 0.00200
</PRE>
<P>TMELT(1) retains its original definition. TMELT(2) has been redefined: </P><PRE>     TMELT(2) - coefficient used for calculating snow melt as a function of
                solar radiation outside the atmosphere
</PRE>
<P>The VLOSSG parameter is now dynamic and will be computed as a function of 
soil texture based on clay content. The VLOSSG parameter value read from the 
FIX.100 file is used as a multiplier for tuning this equation. The conversion 
utility will set the VLOSSG parameter value in a FIX.100 file to 1.0 so there 
will be no multiplicative effect. </P>
<H3>TREE.100</H3>
<P>The TREE.100 file used by Century version 4.5 has 15 additional parameters: 
</P><PRE>     TFRTCN(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to fine roots under maximum

<P>The TFRTCN(*) and TFRTCW(*) parameters are used in the new dynamic carbon 
allocation routines. TFRTCN(1) is inserted into the tree parameterization 
following the FCFRAC(5,2) parameter followed by TFRTCN(2), TFRTCW(1), and 
TFRTCW(2). The TFRTCW(2) parameter and precedes the LEAFDR(1) parameter. </P>
<P>When running the conversion utility the FRFRAC(*) parameters are given the 
following default values: </P><PRE>     TFRTCN(1) - 0.40000
     TFRTCN(2) - 0.25000
     TFRTCW(1) - 0.36000
     TFRTCW(2) - 0.30000
</PRE>
<P>The MAXNP, KMRSP(2), FKMRSPMX(1), FKMRSPMX(2), FKMRSPMX(3), FKMRSPMX(4), and 
FKMRSPMX(5) parameters are used in the new maintenance respiration routines. 
These parameters are give the following default values: </P><PRE>     MAXNP       - 13.5000
     KMRSP(2)    - 0.30000
     FKMRSPMX(1) - 0.00400
     FKMRSPMX(2) - 0.00400
     FKMRSPMX(3) - 0.00400
     FKMRSPMX(4) - 0.00400
     FKMRSPMX(5) - 0.00400
</PRE>
<P>The NO3PREF(2) parameter is not being used by the model currently but is 
included in this conversion utility for compatability with anticipated future 
code changes. The NO3PREF(2) parameter is given a default value of 0.50000. </P>
<P>The MAXNP, KMRSP(2), FKMRSPMX(1), FKMRSPMX(2), FKMRSPMX(3), FKMRSPMX(4), and 
FKMRSPMX(5) parameters follow the SITPOT parameter. </P>
<P>The SITPOT parameter is now dynamic and will be computed as a function of 
average annual precipitation. The SITPOT parameter value read from the TREE.100 
file is used as a multiplier for tuning this equation. This conversion utility 
will set all of the SITPOT parameter values in a TREE.100 file to 1.0 so there 
will be no multiplicative effect. </P>
<P>The definition for the PRDX(2) parameter has been changed and each tree 
option in the tree.100 file should have the value for PRDX(2) set to a default 
value of 0.5. New Century 4.5 PRDX(2) definition: </P><PRE>     PRDX(2) - coefficient for calculating potential monthly forest
               production as a function of solar radiation outside the
               atmosphere
</PRE>
<P>The PRDX(3) parameter is no longer being used and has been removed from the 
tree.100 file. </P>
<P>The equation for computing tree basal area has been changed therefore BASFCT 
is given a a default value of 1.0. </P>
<P>The TLAYPG parameter is added to the end of each tree option in the tree.100 
file. It is given a default value of 6. </P>
<P>The TMPLFF and TMPLFS temperature values are added to the end of each tree 
option in the tree.100 file. They are given default values of 7.0 and 10.0 
respecitively. </P>
<H3><I>site</I>.100</H3>
<P>There have been three parameters added to this file. </P><PRE>     ROCK   - fraction of rock in soil (0.0 - 1.0)
     PRECRO - the amount of monthly rainfall required in order for runoff to
              occur (cm) (used by monthly Century only)
     FRACRO - the fraction of the monthly rainfall, over PRECRO, which is lost
              via runoff (0.0 - 1.0) (used by monthly Century only)
</PRE>
<P>The ROCK parameter is added following the CLAY parameter and is used to 
modify AFIEL and AWILT values if SWFLAG is not equal to 0. Set this parameter 
value to 0.0 to run a simulation with no rock effect on field capacity and 
wilting point values. </P>
<P>The PRECRO and FRACRO paramters are added following the STORMF parameter and 
are used in place of hard coded values for computing the runoff amount in 
monthly Century. </P>
<P>The following default values are assigned to these parameters by the 
conversion utility: </P><PRE>     ROCK   - 0.00000 
     PRECRO - 8.00000
     FRACRO - 0.15000
</PRE>
<P>The equation for computing the non-symbiotic soil N fixation has been 
changed. This change requires a modification of the EPNFS(*) parameter values. 
The following are the default values used for the EPNFS(*) parameters: </P><PRE>     EPNFS(1) - 30.0000
     EPNFS(2) - 0.01000
</PRE>
<P>The WD?LIG parameters are obsolete and need to be removed from the <SITE>.100 
file if necessary. </P>
<H3>Management Schedule File Changes</H3>
<P>We have added the option to do a shift in soil pH if desired. The pH shift 
change requires adding additional lines to the schedule file. The pH shift is 
implemented in much the same manner as the CO2 effect. If the value for PHSYS as 
read from the schedule file is greater than 0 then the next line in the schedule 
file contains the start year and end year for the pH effect and then another 
additional line in the schedule file gives the ending pH amount. The pH in the 
soil will be ramped from the start value to the end value over the period of 
years indicated. If the pH shift is not being modeled a value of -1 should be 
read in for the PHSYS variable. </P>
<P>Example Century 4.5 schedule file header excerpt with no pH shift: </P><PRE>-1             CO2 Systems
-1             pH shift
1             Initial system
</PRE>
<P>Example Century 4.5 schedule file header excerpt with pH shift: </P><PRE>-1             CO2 Systems

1             Initial system
</PRE>
<P>The conversion utility will modify an existing Century 4.0 schedule file to 
add the header line for no pH shift. </P>
<P>We have also added an option to simulate soil surface temperature warming 
experiments where the soil surface temperature is warmed without an increase in 
the minimum and maximum air temperature values if desired. The soil surface 
warming option is implemented in the same manner the CO2 effect and the pH shift 
effect options. If the value for stsys as read from the schedule file header is 
greater than 0 then the next line in the schedule file header contains the start 
year for the soil surface warming and the following line contains the amount to 
warm the soil surface temperature in degrees C. </P>
<P>Example Century 4.5 schedule file header excerpt with no temperature warming 
experiment: </P><PRE>-1             CO2 Systems
-1             pH shift
-1             Soil warming
</PRE>
<P>Example Century 4.5 schedule file header excerpt with temperature warming 
experiment: </P><PRE>-1             CO2 Systems

</PRE>
<P>For block headers in Century 4.5, the Output Interval is an integer multiple 
of 1 month. In version 4 and 5, the interval is a floating-point multiple of 
1/12, or 0.0833, where 1/12 = monthly, and 1.0 = annual output. Century 4.5 
requires the interval to an integer, or it will fail with a Fortran format 
error. </P>
<P>Century 4.5 schedule files should not contain tabs to separate information in 
the file, otherwise it may fail since the tab characters may end up in the event 
option strings (e.g., 1 1 CROP &lt;new line&gt; CPR; internally the string "CPR" 
may look like "CPR&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;"), causing the *.100 database search to 
fail. </P></DIV>
